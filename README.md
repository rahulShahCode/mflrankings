# MFL Player Rankings
This is a simple python script that retrieves [Boris Chen's Player Rankings](borischen.co) and identifies
player availability and ownership based on the weekly rankings. 


# Current Progress
Currently the project only retrieves the tiered rankings from Boris's website. I'm working on 
using MyFantasyLeague's RESTful API to access my team roster and the players of the league I'm in.

I'm doing this because other apps don't identify all available players. We have duplicate players in our league
which isn't recognized by other applications such as FantasyPros. I'm also trying to work with more data, and eventually
visualize it in a Jupyter Notebook.
